# Overview of ABC Retail's Order Processing System Challenges
ABC Retail, a rapidly expanding online retailer, is currently managing its order processing using an outdated on-premises infrastructure. This setup relies on a traditional relational database for storing customer orders and product information, which becomes overwhelmed during high-traffic periods such as Christmas and other holidays.

Additionally, product images are stored on network shared drives, causing inefficiencies and slow access times. The existing message queuing system, built on legacy middleware, lacks the necessary scalability and reliability, leading to delays in message delivery and processing errors. Consequently, ABC Retail faces customer complaints, missed sales opportunities, and operational inefficiencies.

Despite moving their order processing system to the cloud, ABC Retail continues to struggle with real-time event processing and reliable message queuing. Their current infrastructure consists of a mix of custom-built event processing pipelines and third-party messaging solutions that do not scale or flexibly meet the growing business demands. This results in delays in order processing, inconsistent message delivery, and challenges in maintaining and scaling their infrastructure.

ABC Retail's data analytics capabilities are also lagging. The current system, based on traditional relational databases and on-premises analytics tools, is unable to handle the growing volume and complexity of customer data efficiently. This leads to delays in generating actionable insights, affecting the personalization of customer experiences, optimization of product recommendations, and overall operational efficiency.
